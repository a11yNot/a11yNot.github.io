<h1>About a11yNot</h1>

<h2>What is an a11yNot?</h2>
<p>An a11yNot is something on a webpage that creates a barrier for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>If you encounter an a11yNot, we'd love to <a href="/contribute.html">add it to the site</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Nots?</h2>
<p>if you look around, you'll see that there are a few code repositories for "good" accessibility, but nothing &#40;other than <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/">BAD</a>&#41; for bad examples.</p>
<p>I also remember learning a lot from <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/">Web Pages that Suck</a> and was really hooked on their tagline of "Learn Good Web Design by Looking at Bad Web Design."</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will also prove useful for those new to accessibility that would benefit from studying discrete examples of accessibility issues.</p>

<h2>Site Goals</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pass all automated accessibility tool checks.
	<li>Only fail automated accessibility tool checks demonstrated in each Not.
	<li>Document types of issues found by automated accessibility tools.
</ul>
